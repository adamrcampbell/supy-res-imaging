    "- [x] Generate 6 dataset subsets, containing timesteps each (i.e., 30 time steps / 5 time steps per file)\n",
    "- [x] Generate one point spread function per dataset subset, for analysis of different\n",
    "- [x] Generate one point spread function for the whole dataset\n",
    "- [x] Determine if there is a significant difference between a subset PSF and the full dataset PSF - this will be the blur kernel\n",
    "- [ ] Determine if the PSF can be reduced (i.e., dont use the full PSF) - what effects might this have?\n",
    "- [x] Generate an IDFT of the full dataset, $L^2$ pixels\n",
    "- [x] Genetate an IDFT for each of the subsets, $M^2$ pixels\n",
    "- [x] Come up with a formula for populating the decimation matrix\n",
    "- [ ] Come up with a formula for populating the blur matrix \n",
    "- [ ] Determine if there is a formula for populating the product of the blur and decimation matrix, such that $H^TD^T = (HD)^T$\n",
    "- [ ] take the average of optimal betas across support 20 to 47, use that for all supports, plot the error between solved x and true x using the averaged beta, and compare that against another plot which is the \"optimal\" beta vs support\n",
    "- [ ] another thing to try, consider trimming the edge of solved x before taking norms and measuring RRMSE, as the convolution matrices are not padded and so convolution is essentially \"incomplete\" around the image edges. Probably only need to take say 10-15 pixels off all edges, since most of the PSF is noise aside from the center.\n",
    "- [ ] Another thing to try is to produce a set of Y images which are only representative of a single source, like a PSF. Then I could run the SOLE algorithm to determine what the effects of solving are against the curve of a point source, by taking a middle slice of the image (like I do when inspecting the actual PSF). Could examine what happens when using different supports and beta terms to see which lines up best with the true curve.\n",
    " - [ ] I need to modify the decimation matrix function to support more than just 4 neighbours (or 1/2 decimation).\n",
    " - [ ] Modify the project so it is more like a library, where I can call my own functions in my desired order. This would make repeating experiments easier than one flat notebook.\n",

    "- If one takes the $\\beta S^T S$ portion of $A$ and multiplies it by the solved $X$;  assuming the result is not normalised, one can observe the contribution of beta-influenced laplacian sharpening towards $B$. It appears to float around 10% of the second portion of $A$ (the decimated PSF) multiplied by the solved $X$. Taking the sum of these two separate portions of $AX$ allow one to produce $B$. It appears that the laplacian sharpening portion of $A$ does meaningfully contribute to help find a reasonable solution to $X$, and doesnt appear to be dominating (i.e., drowning out) the decimated PSF portion of $A$.\n",
    "- Essentially, we dont want the beta-driven laplacian to dominate the sharpened PSF, otherwise you end up with effectively an overly smooth image $X$, and the technique becomes less useful / less impressive. We want to solve for $X$, such that beta helps us resolve a more accurate image $X$ which isnt just noise (a lack of structure, looks like static), and also doesnt look too smooth. If solving was less useful because we required large beta terms, then we might as well just average our set of $Y$ low-resolution images instead since its computationally cheaper?"
